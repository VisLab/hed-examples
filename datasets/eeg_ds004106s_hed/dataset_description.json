  "Acknowledgments": "Tony Johnson and Mike Dunkel from DCS Corporation originally curated the data in ESS (EEG Study Schema) format. Kay Robbins, Joe Lambeth and Jonathan Balraj placed this dataset in BIDS format. The experiments were performed at SAIC (Louisville, CO) under contract with the US Army Research Laboratory. The study was reviewed and approved by the U.S. Army Human Research Protections Office (Protocol ARL 12-041) before the study began.",
